# COMP6721_Group_D

Project Repository for Comp 6721 - Applied Artificial Intelligence


# Repository Overview #

This repository contains mainly related three things. <br />
1. Trained Models <br />
2. Sample Datasets <br />
3. Documentations<br />
4. Assignment Submissions <br />
## Trained Models ##

There are 3 folders named: [AlexNet](/AlexNet), [ResNet](/ResNet), [VGG](/VGG). These folders contains 3 jupyter notebooks in which we have trained our models. <br />

Each folder mentioned above contains 3 files and which are separated for each Dataset.<br />

There is also a folder named "Transfer Learning" which conaines two jupyter notebook
which are trained using Transfer Learning on VGG model.  <br />

The models which are performing hyperparameter tuning we have created a separate branch for VGG and submitted the files over there. <br />
File path: [HypterParameter Tuning Notebooks](/VGG/VGGnetProject-dataset1.ipynb)

## Sample Datasets ##

We have used 3 datasets for which external links are available as below:
1) Dataset1 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database <br />
2) Dataset2 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanullahasraf/covid19-pneumonia-normal-chest-xray-pa-dataset <br />
3) Dataset3 : https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset <br />


## Documentations ##

In the Document folder, we have added following file: <br />
1. Project Proposal <br />
2. Progress Report <br />
3. Project Final Report <br />
4. Project Presentation <br />
5. Video Presentation <br />
